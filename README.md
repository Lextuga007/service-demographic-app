# Service demographic analysis

An app to compare local data with public demographic data.

* The top chart is for the local service data and the bottom chart can either show local or public data to compare. 
* Depending on the selection made for ethnicity group (Detail, Grouped or Public) both the chart and further selection boxes change.
* Publicly available IMD data with ethnicity is only available by Quintile and not Decile.

The local data used in this app has been generated from random sequencing. However, for ethnicity_detail the probability frequency was set by previously randomised health data. This gives a more realistic breakdown of ethnicity groups.
